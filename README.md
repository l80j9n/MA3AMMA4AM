1.          Consider   the problem
x..   +   x +   μx2      = 0   ,               0 < μ   <<   1 ,   x(0;   μ) = 1,               x.(0;   μ)   = 0 .
(a)       Show that                  x.2      = (1−   x)   (1+   x + 23 μ(1+   x +   x2 ))   .
Hence sketch the trajectory in the phase plane and deduce that the motion is periodic.
(b)      Show that the straightforward expansion for    x    is
x(t ;   μ)    =    cost + μ      −   
+   μ2       sint −         )+   .   .   .   and deduce that the region of   non-uniformity   is          t   = O(1μ   .
(c)      Using   the   method   of   renormalisation   with
t = T(1+   f1μ+   f2μ2   + ...)
show that the    s.e. in (a) can be rendered uniform,   and   show that   a uniform   expansion   is   x      =   cosT   +   μ   −   
+   μ2    −         )   +   .   .   .   where         t   = T(12    +   .   .   .)   .
(d)    Apply   Linstedt’s   method   to   this   problem   withx(t   ;   μ) = X(T   ;   μ)             ,                T   = t(1+   w1 μ+   w2   μ2   + ...)      to deduce the uniformly valid
expansion in   (c).
(You will   show that       w1    = 0 ,       w2      = − 512       .)
2.          (FOR STUDENTS TAKING MA4AM. NOT FOR   STUDENTS TAKING   MA3AM.)   Apply   the   method   of   multiple   scales   to   Duffing’s   equation
x..   +   x   +   μx3   = 0 ,               0   <   μ<< 1   ,             x(0; μ) = 1   ,                x.(0; μ) = 0
with slow variable/scale    ξ   = μt   ,    fast variable/scale    η= t(1+   w2   μ2    + ...)       to deduce the   uniformly valid expansion
x(t ;   μ)    =    cos(
where    ξ   = μt ,      η= t(1+ O(μ )),    and       C

C0 (0) = 1,   φ0 (0)   = 0 .       Then   show   that      C0 (ξ)   三 1,    φ0 (ξ) = 38   ξ.       Deduce   the   conditions   above on      C1,φ1   ,    but do not attempt to find       C1   (ξ)   ,   φ1   (ξ)      or    w2.]
3.          Consider the problem
x..   +   x = μ(1-   x2   )x.   ,               0   <   μ<< 1   .
(a)      Show that the straightforward expansion only gives a uniformly valid   solution   for the   limit   cycle solution
x = 2   cos(t +   α0 ) +   μ(c1   cos(t +   α1   )   -      (α0 ,α1 ,   c1       constants).
Hint: Review Problem   Sheet   1: Question 2  its   Solution.

where      K,   φ0          are constants,      ξ   = μt ,   η= t   (1+ O(μ2   ))   .
(Note:    Write the solution for       X0          as in Question 2,   and   deduce that      φ0 (ξ)   = constant .)   (FOR STUDENTS TAKING MA4AM. NOT FOR STUDENTS TAKING MA3AM.)
(c)       Show that if    x(0;   μ) = 0   ,       x.(0;   μ) = 6      then      K =    ,   φ0    = -      .
4.          Consider the problem
x..   +   x +   x3      =   0
